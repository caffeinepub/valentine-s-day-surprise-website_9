  "summary": "Design and build a responsive 3-page Valentine’s Day surprise website with editable custom text, a three-video upload/display page with editable headings, a final vibrant pink page with a centered dark pink text box and subtle animated floating hearts, plus a save/progress feature backed by cloud database storage that supports cross-user viewing of the latest saved progress and real-time updates (e.g., via WebSockets) with authentication and conflict-safe concurrency handling.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Responsive design for desktop and mobile across all pages",
    "Romantic color scheme (pinks/reds) with strong legibility and user-friendly layout",
    "Avoid excessive animations; keep heart animations subtle and non-distracting",
    "Editable text fields on page 1 and page 3; editable headings for each video on page 2",
    "Replace local-only persistence with server-side persistence for cross-device access (e.g., save to backend and restore via unique URL/token).",
    "Design save/restore to be scalable and secure (rate limiting, input validation, encryption in transit, and safe token generation) while maintaining major-browser compatibility and good performance.",
    "Support shared progress visible to any viewer by storing the canonical state in a cloud database (not solely local storage or per-link restore).",
    "Use real-time transport (e.g., WebSockets/SSE) to broadcast snapshot changes to connected clients.",
    "Define authentication + authorization model for reading/writing progress; enforce security server-side with least privilege.",
    "Ensure data integrity under concurrent writes using versioning/optimistic locking and well-defined conflict resolution."

  "known_issues": [
    "Clicking the Save button shows \"save failed\" due to missing/broken backend connectivity for video saving; videos are not being persisted for cross-user viewing."
