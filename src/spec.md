## Summary
**Goal:** Update the 3-page Valentine site to closely match the reference webpage’s overall styling, and clarify/polish the Videos page as a “Featured Videos” section while keeping the same three MP4 sources.

**Planned changes:**
- Align Landing, Videos, and Final Message pages to the reference page’s look-and-feel (color usage, typography, spacing, and component styling) using original styling and standard components (no copying copyrighted assets).
- Update the Videos page header and surrounding copy so the section title is exactly “Featured Videos”, while continuing to embed only the three provided MP4 URLs.
- Improve responsive layout and navigation across mobile/tablet/desktop, including an adaptive video grid that remains playable with visible controls across major browsers.

**User-visible outcome:** The Valentine site presents a cohesive, reference-inspired design across all three pages, with a clearly labeled “Featured Videos” section that displays the same three embedded videos in a responsive, easy-to-navigate layout.
