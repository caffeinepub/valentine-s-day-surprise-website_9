  "summary": "REQ-39 is mostly implemented in App.tsx for landingMessage and videoSlots defaults (headings + unchanged URLs) and REQ-40 comments are present, but the finalMessage default does not exactly match the required multiline text (uses straight apostrophes instead of curly apostrophes), which violates the “set exactly” requirement. Additionally, non-requested metadata files were modified.",

      "requirement": "Set `finalMessage` default exactly to the provided multiline text (including curly apostrophes and line breaks).",
      "reason": "The diff shows the finalMessage initializer text differs from the required string: it uses straight apostrophes (e.g., \"Valentine's\", \"I've\", \"I'm\", \"I'd\") instead of the specified curly apostrophes (e.g., \"Valentine’s\", \"I’ve\", \"I’m\", \"I’d\"). Because the requirement says \"set exactly\", this is not fully implemented.",
